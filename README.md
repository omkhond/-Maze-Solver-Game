# 🌀 Maze Solver Game  

## 🧩 Overview  
**Maze Solver Game** is an interactive Python project built using the **Tkinter** library. It challenges players to navigate from a **start point (yellow)** to an **exit point (green)** inside a randomly generated maze. The game combines logical thinking, pathfinding, and real-time decision-making to create an engaging experience.  

Each maze is generated using a **Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm**, ensuring every playthrough offers a new challenge. Players can select from **three difficulty levels** — *Easy*, *Medium*, and *Hard* — each changing the maze’s complexity and size.
